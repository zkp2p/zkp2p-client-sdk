# API Performance Issue - Example Template

## Issue Description

Describe the specific performance issue or bug that needs to be addressed. Include symptoms, affected features, and user impact.

Example: "API endpoint `/api/data/process` has intermittent high latency (>5 seconds) under normal load conditions, causing user timeout errors."

## Root Cause

Detailed analysis of what's causing the issue. Include:
- Technical root cause
- Contributing factors
- System conditions that trigger the issue

Example: "Database query optimization needed for complex joins. Current query scans entire table without proper indexing."

## Impact Assessment

- **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Affected Users**: Percentage or number of users impacted
- **Business Impact**: Revenue, user experience, or operational impact
- **Workarounds**: Any temporary solutions currently in place

## Proposed Solution

### Technical Approach
Detailed technical solution including:
- Code changes required
- Architecture modifications
- Database schema updates
- Performance improvements expected

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Initial fixes (timeline)
2. **Phase 2**: Optimization improvements (timeline)
3. **Phase 3**: Monitoring and validation (timeline)

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Specific test cases to validate the fix
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing and benchmarking
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure no existing functionality breaks
