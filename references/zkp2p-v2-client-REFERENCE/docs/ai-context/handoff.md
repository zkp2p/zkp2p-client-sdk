# Task Management & Handoff Documentation

This file manages task continuity, session transitions, and knowledge transfer for AI-assisted development sessions.

## Purpose

This template helps maintain:
- **Session continuity** between AI development sessions
- **Task status tracking** for complex, multi-session work
- **Context preservation** when switching between team members
- **Knowledge transfer** for project handoffs
- **Progress documentation** for ongoing development efforts

## Current Session Status (2025-07-20)

### Active Tasks
Currently preparing for dependency migration:

```markdown
## In Progress
- [ ] Dependency Migration Preparation
  - Status: Documentation updated, ready for migration
  - Context: Comprehensive documentation review completed
  - Next steps: Begin upgrading core dependencies
  - Dependencies: None - documentation is now current
```

### Completed Tasks
Documentation updates completed this session:

```markdown
## Completed This Session (2025-07-20)
- [x] Documentation State Review
  - Completed: 2025-07-20
  - Outcome: Comprehensive review of codebase state
  - Files changed: 
    - /docs/ai-context/project-structure.md (updated tech stack, file tree)
    - /CLAUDE.md (added missing contexts, updated contract methods)
    - /docs/ai-context/docs-overview.md (restructured for single-repo project)
  - Key findings:
    - New dependencies: Solana, Material UI, Tailwind CSS, cross-chain bridges
    - Undocumented features: Send feature, additional payment platforms
    - Missing contexts: ExtensionProxyProofs, Geolocation, TokenData, etc.
    - File structure changes: CompleteOrder flow, new test organization

- [x] Technology Stack Updates
  - Updated versions: Vite 7.0.3, RainbowKit 1.3.5
  - New integrations: Solana support, Reservoir cross-chain, Socket bridge
  - UI frameworks: Material UI + Tailwind CSS alongside styled-components
  - Monitoring: Rollbar error tracking added
```

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Key Findings from Documentation Review

```markdown
## Architectural Discoveries
- **Multiple UI Frameworks**: Project uses styled-components, Material UI, and Tailwind CSS
  - Date: Discovered 2025-07-20
  - Impact: Increases bundle size and complexity
  - Recommendation: Consolidate to 1-2 frameworks max
  - Migration path: Analyze component usage patterns first

- **Cross-Chain Support**: Two bridging solutions (Relay SDK and Socket)
  - Context: Both provide similar functionality
  - Trade-offs: Redundancy vs. fallback options
  - Recommendation: Evaluate usage patterns before removing either

- **Dynamic Token Support**: TokenDataContext enables multi-token functionality
  - Impact: Send feature supports any ERC20 token
  - Note: Token verification status tracking implemented
  - Recent fix: TokenDataProvider improved token ID normalization
```

### Technical Debt & Issues
Track technical debt and known issues:

```markdown
## Technical Debt Identified
- **Issue**: [Description of technical debt]
  - Location: [Where in codebase]
  - Impact: [How it affects development/performance]
  - Proposed solution: [How to address it]
  - Priority: [When should this be addressed]

- **Issue**: [Another issue]
  - Root cause: [Why this debt exists]
  - Workaround: [Current mitigation strategy]
  - Long-term fix: [Proper solution approach]
```

## Next Session Goals

### Immediate Priorities
Ready for dependency migration:

```markdown
## Next Session Priorities
1. **Primary Goal**: Core dependency upgrades
   - Success criteria: All dependencies updated with passing tests
   - Key dependencies to consider:
     - React 18.2.0 → Latest stable
     - TypeScript 5.3.3 → Latest 5.x
     - Vite 7.0.3 → Latest stable
     - Vitest 3.2.4 → Latest compatible
   - Prerequisites: Documentation is now current ✓
   - Estimated effort: 2-4 hours depending on breaking changes

2. **Secondary Goal**: UI framework consolidation
   - Dependencies: After core upgrades complete
   - Resources needed: Decision on Material UI vs Tailwind CSS strategy
   - Current state: Three UI frameworks (styled-components, MUI, Tailwind)

3. **If Time Permits**: Cross-chain feature optimization
   - Context: Relay and Socket bridges both present
   - Preparation: Analyze usage patterns to determine if both needed
```

### Areas Requiring Attention During Migration

```markdown
## Migration Considerations
- **UI Framework Strategy**: Three frameworks present (styled-components, MUI, Tailwind)
  - Impact: Bundle size and maintainability
  - Research needed: Component usage analysis
  - Decision: Standardize on 1-2 frameworks

- **Solana Integration**: Partial implementation found
  - Current state: Dependencies present but limited usage
  - Options: Complete integration or remove dependencies
  - Timeline: Decide before major release

- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test infrastructure exists
  - Strength: Good business logic coverage
  - Gap: Component testing could be expanded
  - Action: Maintain test quality during migration
```

## Context for Continuation

### Key Files & Components

```markdown
## Files Modified This Session
- `/docs/ai-context/project-structure.md`: Technology stack and file tree updated to current state
- `/CLAUDE.md`: Added missing contexts, updated contract methods, documented new features
- `/docs/ai-context/docs-overview.md`: Restructured for single-repository project
- `/docs/ai-context/handoff.md`: This file - session documentation

## Important Context Files for Migration
- `/package.json`: Source of truth for dependency versions
- `/vite.config.ts`: Build configuration that may need updates
- `/src/contexts/`: All 12 context providers - check for breaking changes
- `/src/helpers/types/`: Type definitions that may need updates
- `/src/test/`: Test infrastructure to validate migration

## Documentation State
