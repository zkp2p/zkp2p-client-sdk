You are working on the current project. Before proceeding with the user's request "$ARGUMENTS", you need to intelligently gather relevant project context using an adaptive sub-agent strategy.

## Auto-Loaded Project Context:
@/CLAUDE.md
@/docs/ai-context/project-structure.md
@/docs/ai-context/docs-overview.md

## Step 1: Intelligent Analysis Strategy Decision
Think deeply about the optimal approach based on the project context that has been auto-loaded above. Based on the user's request "$ARGUMENTS" and the project structure/documentation overview, intelligently decide the optimal approach:

### Strategy Options:
**Direct Approach** (0-1 sub-agents):
- When the request can be handled efficiently with targeted documentation reading and direct analysis
- Simple questions about existing code or straightforward tasks

**Focused Investigation** (2-3 sub-agents):
- When deep analysis of a specific area would benefit the response
- For complex single-domain questions or tasks requiring thorough exploration
- When dependencies and impacts need careful assessment

**Multi-Perspective Analysis** (3+ sub-agents):
- When the request involves multiple areas, components, or technical domains
- When comprehensive understanding requires different analytical perspectives
- For tasks requiring careful dependency mapping and impact assessment
- Scale the number of agents based on actual complexity, not predetermined patterns

## Step 2: Autonomous Sub-Agent Design

### For Sub-Agent Approach:
You have complete freedom to design sub-agent tasks based on:
- **Project structure discovered** from the auto-loaded `/docs/ai-context/project-structure.md` file tree
- **Documentation architecture** from the auto-loaded `/docs/ai-context/docs-overview.md`
- **Specific user request requirements**
- **Your assessment** of what investigation approach would be most effective

**CRITICAL: When using sub-agents, always launch them in parallel using a single message with multiple Task tool invocations. Never launch sequentially.**

### Sub-Agent Autonomy Principles:
- **Custom Specialization**: Define agent focus areas based on the specific request and project structure
- **Flexible Scope**: Agents can analyze any combination of documentation, code files, and architectural patterns
- **Adaptive Coverage**: Ensure all relevant aspects of the user's request are covered without overlap
- **Documentation + Code**: Each agent should read relevant documentation files AND examine actual implementation code
- **Dependency Mapping**: For tasks involving code changes, analyze import/export relationships and identify all files that would be affected
- **Impact Assessment**: Consider ripple effects across the codebase, including tests, configurations, and related components
- **Pattern Compliance**: Ensure solutions follow existing project conventions for naming, structure, and architecture
- **Cleanup Planning**: For structural changes, identify obsolete code, unused imports, and deprecated files that should be removed to prevent code accumulation
- **Web Research**: Consider, optionally, deploying sub-agents for web searches when current best practices, security advisories, or external compatibility research would enhance the response

### Sub-Agent Task Design Template:
```
Task: "Analyze [SPECIFIC_COMPONENT(S)] for [TASK_OBJECTIVE] related to user request '$ARGUMENTS'"

Standard Investigation Workflow:
1. Review auto-loaded project context (CLAUDE.md, project-structure.md, docs-overview.md)
2. (Optionally) Read additional relevant documentation files for architectural context
3. Analyze actual code files in [COMPONENT(S)] for implementation reality
4. For code-related tasks: Map import/export dependencies and identify affected files
5. Assess impact on tests, configurations, and related components
6. Verify alignment with project patterns and conventions
7. For structural changes: Identify obsolete code, unused imports, and files that should be removed

Return comprehensive findings that address the user's request from this component perspective, including architectural insights, implementation details, dependency mapping, and practical considerations for safe execution."
```

Example Usage:
```
Analysis Task: "Analyze web-dashboard audio processing components to understand current visualization capabilities and identify integration points for user request about adding waveform display"

Implementation Task: "Analyze agents/tutor-server voice pipeline components for latency optimization related to user request about improving response times, including dependency mapping and impact assessment"

Cross-Component Task: "Analyze Socket.IO integration patterns across web-dashboard and tutor-server to plan streaming enhancement for user request about adding live transcription, focusing on import/export changes, affected test files, and cleanup of deprecated socket handlers"
```

## Step 3: Execution and Synthesis

### For Sub-Agent Approach:
Think deeply about integrating findings from all investigation perspectives.
1. **Design and launch custom sub-agents** based on your strategic analysis
2. **Collect findings** from all successfully completed agents
3. **Synthesize comprehensive understanding** by combining all perspectives
4. **Handle partial failures** by working with available agent findings
5. **Create implementation plan** (for code changes): Include dependency updates, affected files, cleanup tasks, and verification steps
6. **Execute user request** using the integrated knowledge from all agents

### For Direct Approach:
1. **Load relevant documentation and code** based on request analysis
2. **Proceed directly** with user request using targeted context

## Step 4: Consider MCP Server Usage (Optional)

After gathering context, you may leverage MCP servers for complex technical questions as specified in the auto-loaded `/CLAUDE.md` Section 4:
- **Gemini Consultation**: Deep analysis of complex coding problems
- **Context7**: Up-to-date documentation for external libraries

## Step 5: Context Summary and Implementation Plan

After gathering context using your chosen approach:
1. **Provide concise status update** summarizing findings and approach:
   - Brief description of what was discovered through your analysis
   - Your planned implementation strategy based on the findings
   - Keep it informative but concise (2-4 sentences max)

Example status updates:
```
"Analysis revealed the voice pipelines use Socket.IO for real-time communication with separate endpoints for each pipeline type. I'll implement the new transcription feature by extending the existing Socket.IO event handling in both the FastAPI backend and SvelteKit frontend, following the established pattern used in the Gemini Live pipeline. This will require updating 3 import statements and adding exports to the socket handler module."

"Found that audio processing currently uses a modular client architecture with separate recorder, processor, and stream-player components. I'll add the requested audio visualization by creating a new component that taps into the existing audio stream data and integrates with the current debug panel structure. The implementation will follow the existing component patterns and requires updates to 2 parent components for proper integration."
```

2. **Proceed with implementation** of the user request using your comprehensive understanding

## Optimization Guidelines

- **Adaptive Decision-Making**: Choose the approach that best serves the specific user request
- **Efficient Resource Use**: Balance thoroughness with efficiency based on actual complexity
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure all aspects relevant to the user's request are addressed
- **Quality Synthesis**: Combine findings effectively to provide the most helpful response

This adaptive approach ensures optimal context gathering - from lightweight direct analysis for simple requests to comprehensive multi-agent investigation for complex system-wide tasks.
