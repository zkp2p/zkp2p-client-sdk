You are concluding work on the current project and need to create a comprehensive handoff for the next AI session. This command intelligently analyzes your current session achievements and updates the handoff document with both auto-detected progress and user-provided context.

## Auto-Loaded Project Context:
@docs/ai-context/HANDOFF.md
@/CLAUDE.md

## Step 1: Process User Arguments

Handle the arguments flexibly:
- **With Arguments**: `$ARGUMENTS` provides user context about what was accomplished or attempted
- **Without Arguments**: Focus purely on auto-detection from session analysis

User provided context: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Step 2: Analyze Current Session Achievements

Think about what was accomplished in this session and how to best capture it for handoff. Review your recent conversation and tool usage to identify significant work:

**Auto-Detect Evidence of:**
- **File Operations** (Write, Edit, MultiEdit tools) - what files were modified and why
- **New Features** - functionality added or implemented
- **Bug Fixes** - issues resolved or debugging attempts
- **Architecture Changes** - structural improvements or refactoring
- **Configuration Updates** - settings, dependencies, or environment changes
- **Documentation Work** - updates to documentation files
- **Incomplete Work** - attempts that didn't reach completion
- **Blockers Encountered** - issues that prevented completion

**Generate Session Summary:**
```
Session Analysis:
- Primary work area: [component/domain affected]
- Main accomplishments: [key achievements]
- Files modified: [list of changed files]
- Status: [completed/in-progress/blocked]
- User context: [if $ARGUMENTS provided]
```

## Step 3: Analyze Auto-Loaded HANDOFF.md

Analyze the auto-loaded `docs/ai-context/HANDOFF.md` to understand:
- **Existing sections** and their current status
- **Related ongoing work** that might connect to your session
- **Structure and formatting** patterns to maintain consistency
- **Unrelated content** that should be preserved

## Step 4: Determine Update Strategy

Think about how to best update the handoff based on this session's work. Based on your session analysis and the auto-loaded existing handoff content, decide:

**If Current Work Relates to Existing Task:**
- Update the existing section with new progress
- Add accomplishments to "What Was Accomplished"
- Update "Current Status" and "Current Issue" if resolved
- Modify "Next Steps" based on new state

**If Current Work is New/Unrelated:**
- Create a new section with descriptive title
- Include timestamp for session identification
- Follow existing document structure and formatting

**If Work Completed an Existing Task:**
- Mark the task as completed
- Summarize final outcome
- Consider archiving or removing if fully resolved

## Step 5: Update HANDOFF.md Intelligently

Make targeted updates to the auto-loaded HANDOFF.md:

### For New Sections, Include:
```markdown
## [Task Title] - [Status]

### Current Status
[Brief description of current state]

### What Was Accomplished
[Bulleted list of concrete achievements with file paths]

### Current Issue (if applicable)
[Any blockers or unresolved problems]

### Next Steps to [Objective]
[Actionable items for continuation]

### Key Files to Review
[List of relevant files organized by category]

### Context for Next Session
[Important notes for continuity]
```

### For Updates to Existing Sections:
- **Add to accomplishments** without duplicating existing content
- **Update status** if progress changed the situation
- **Modify current issues** if problems were resolved or new ones discovered
- **Refresh next steps** based on new progress

## Step 6: Maintain Document Quality

Ensure your updates follow these guidelines:

**Content Quality:**
- **Specific**: Include exact file paths and technical details
- **Actionable**: Provide clear next steps for continuation
- **Contextual**: Explain the reasoning behind decisions
- **Current**: Reflect the actual state after your session

**Formatting Consistency:**
- Follow existing markdown structure and patterns
- Use consistent heading levels and formatting
- Maintain bullet point styles and organization
- Preserve the document's overall structure

**Information Management:**
- **Don't duplicate** existing information unless updating it
- **Preserve unrelated** sections that weren't part of your work
- **Consolidate** related information rather than fragmenting it
- **Archive completed** work appropriately

## Step 7: Final Verification

Before completing, verify that your handoff:
- **Accurately reflects** what was accomplished in the session
- **Combines** auto-detected technical changes with user-provided context
- **Provides clear direction** for the next AI session
- **Maintains continuity** with existing handoff content
- **Is immediately actionable** for someone picking up the work

## Quality Standards

**Be Comprehensive But Concise:**
- Include all relevant technical details
- Focus on actionable information
- Avoid redundancy with existing content

**Maintain Professional Handoff Quality:**
- Clear problem statements and current status
- Specific file references and technical context
- Logical next steps that build on current progress
- Helpful context that speeds up the next session

This intelligent handoff approach ensures smooth continuity between AI sessions while capturing both the technical reality of what was accomplished and the user's perspective on the work.

Now analyze your session, combine it with the user context "$ARGUMENTS", and update the handoff document accordingly.
