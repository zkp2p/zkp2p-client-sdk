# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## [2.1.0] - 2025-09-02

### Added
- Versioned subpath imports for API versions: `@zkp2p/client-sdk/v1` and `@zkp2p/client-sdk/v2` (Google-style).
- `v1` entry re-exports the existing stable client, types, constants, utilities, and React hooks.
- `v2` entry scaffolded as a stub to enable early integration without bundling v1 shapes.

### Changed
- Documentation updated to recommend versioned imports for better tree-shaking and compile-time isolation.
- Examples now import extension-only helpers from `@zkp2p/client-sdk/extension` explicitly.
- Build configured to emit v1/v2 bundles; package `exports` updated accordingly.

### Notes
- The v2 entry is a placeholder and will be implemented when the V2 API is available.
- Root import (`@zkp2p/client-sdk`) continues to expose v1 for backward compatibility.
