          # Automated review prompt for ZKP2P Client SDK (TypeScript SDK)
          prompt: |
            Please review this pull request for the ZKP2P Client SDK.
            
            This is a TypeScript SDK for integrating ZKP2P functionality into applications.
            It's structured as a monorepo with packages for different platforms.
            
            Focus on:
            - SDK design patterns and API ergonomics
            - TypeScript type safety and proper typing
            - Browser and Node.js compatibility
            - Error handling and developer experience
            - Documentation completeness and clarity
            - Package structure and exports configuration
            - Semantic versioning considerations
            - Test coverage for SDK methods
            - Bundle size and tree-shaking support
            - Cross-platform compatibility (web, mobile, node)
            - Smart contract interaction abstractions
            - Proper async/await patterns and promise handling
            
            The project uses npm as its package manager. Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
            After this initial review, you'll respond to any @claude mentions for follow-up questions.
